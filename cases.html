      <h3>🎯 WhatsApp Loan Scam</h3>
      <p>A college student in Delhi received an unsolicited WhatsApp message offering instant loans at low-interest rates. The scammer asked for an upfront processing fee of ₹1,500. The student sent the payment and then received further requests for more money. Eventually, the scammer disappeared with the student’s ₹5,000.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Always verify any loan offers. Financial institutions never ask for upfront fees. Be cautious of unsolicited messages from unknown sources offering “easy money.”</p>
    </div>

      <h3>👩‍💻 Fake OnlyFans Link Scam</h3>
      <p>A popular influencer received an unsolicited direct message on Instagram, offering access to an “exclusive” OnlyFans link. The message claimed to provide a special discount on subscriptions. Upon clicking the link, the victim unknowingly shared their login credentials, leading to a data breach.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Always verify links and avoid clicking on suspicious social media messages, especially from unknown accounts. Protect your login information by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>🏦 Bank Verification Call Fraud</h3>
      <p>A man in Mumbai received a call from someone pretending to be from his bank, stating his account was at risk of being frozen unless he verified his credentials immediately. The scammer asked for OTPs and bank details, which were then used to withdraw ₹30,000 from his account.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Banks will never call you asking for OTPs or sensitive information. Always hang up and call the bank directly to verify the request. Never share personal information over the phone unless you initiated the contact.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>📧 Email Phishing Attack</h3>
      <p>A corporate employee received a phishing email that appeared to be from their company’s HR department. The email asked them to log into a “new company portal” by clicking on a provided link. After entering their login details, the employee's credentials were stolen and used to access sensitive company data.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Always check the sender’s email address and verify the legitimacy of unexpected emails. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>📱 Fake Tech Support Scam</h3>
      <p>A woman in Chennai received a pop-up notification on her computer claiming that her system had a virus and that she needed to call a tech support number to fix the issue. The scammer convinced her to provide remote access to her computer and later asked for payment to remove the virus, which was non-existent.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Never trust pop-up notifications that ask you to call a number or download software. Contact your tech support team directly if you suspect a problem with your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>💳 Credit Card Skimming</h3>
      <p>A customer in Bengaluru noticed unauthorized transactions on his credit card statement. After an investigation, it was found that a skimming device had been installed on an ATM he used, capturing his card information and PIN when he withdrew cash.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Always inspect ATMs or point-of-sale machines for unusual devices or tampering. Cover your hand when entering your PIN and report suspicious devices immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>🔒 SIM Swap Fraud</h3>
      <p>A woman in Kolkata received a call from her mobile provider claiming that her SIM card needed to be reactivated due to “network issues.” After following the instructions, her phone lost service, and shortly afterward, fraudulent transactions were made using her bank details linked to her phone number.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Never share your SIM card information or PIN with anyone, even if they claim to be from your mobile provider. Always call your service provider directly if you receive such requests.</p>
