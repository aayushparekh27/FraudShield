    <h2>Types of Cyber Fraud</h2>
    <p>Cyber fraud is a major threat in the digital world. Fraudsters use various techniques to deceive victims and steal sensitive information or money. Below, we cover the most common types of cyber fraud, how they work, and what steps you can take to protect yourself.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="intro-section">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>üîê Phishing Attacks</h3>
      <p>Phishing scams involve fraudulent messages (emails, SMS, or calls) pretending to be legitimate organizations to steal sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account details. These messages often appear urgent or threatening to provoke immediate action from victims.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> An email claiming to be from your bank asking you to update your password due to a "security breach," or a text message from a "delivery service" asking you to click a link to reschedule a delivery.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Unsolicited messages, suspicious links, urgent requests for personal information, grammatical errors in the message.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Never click on unknown links or attachments. Always verify emails or SMS messages by contacting the company directly using official channels. Use anti-phishing browser extensions to help detect suspicious websites.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>üíª Ransomware</h3>
      <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software that locks users out of their devices or files and demands a ransom for access restoration. This fraud usually spreads through infected email attachments, malicious ads, or compromised websites.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A message appearing on your screen claiming to be from law enforcement, stating that your computer has been locked due to illegal activity and demanding payment in cryptocurrency to unlock it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Unusual system behavior, encrypted files that can't be opened, ransom notes that appear demanding payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Always keep your operating system and software up to date. Install reputable antivirus software and use a firewall. Back up your files regularly to prevent data loss. Be cautious when downloading files or clicking on links from unknown sources.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>üßë‚Äçüíª Identity Theft</h3>
      <p>Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information (e.g., your social security number, date of birth, or bank details) to commit fraud, take out loans, or open accounts in your name.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A criminal using your information to apply for credit cards, loans, or even filing false tax returns in your name.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Unauthorized transactions, unfamiliar credit reports, missing mail, or being contacted by debt collectors for charges you didn't make.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts and change them regularly. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security. Regularly monitor your credit report and financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Consider freezing your credit to prevent new accounts from being opened in your name.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>üí≥ Credit Card Fraud</h3>
      <p>Credit card fraud involves fraudulent transactions made using your credit card without your permission. This can happen through stolen credit card details or using fake credit card information generated by fraudsters.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A criminal making online purchases using your credit card number or using your credit card information to make withdrawals at ATMs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Unexpected charges on your statement, unfamiliar purchase locations, or receiving a notification about a charge that you didn‚Äôt make.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Enable alerts for every transaction on your credit card. Use virtual credit card numbers for online purchases. Regularly check your credit card statement and report unauthorized charges immediately. Use credit card providers that offer fraud protection services.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>üõë Online Auction Fraud</h3>
      <p>In online auction fraud, scammers trick buyers into paying for items that do not exist or are not as described in the auction listing.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A fraudster creates a fake listing for high-demand products (like electronics or designer goods), receives payment, and disappears without sending the item.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Sellers who refuse to provide additional information, rush the sale, or offer deals that seem too good to be true.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Stick to trusted and well-known auction platforms. Avoid paying directly to individuals through wire transfers or untraceable payment methods. Always read reviews and check the seller‚Äôs reputation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>üì± Social Engineering Scams</h3>
      <p>Social engineering scams involve manipulating individuals into divulging confidential or personal information. Fraudsters use psychological tricks to convince victims to make a mistake or reveal sensitive data.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> A fraudster impersonating an IT technician to convince you to install malicious software or provide login credentials over the phone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Requests for personal information or passwords, pressure to act quickly, or requests that seem out of the ordinary.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Be cautious when someone asks for your personal information, especially over the phone or email. Always verify the identity of the person or company contacting you before sharing any sensitive data.</li>
      </ul>
